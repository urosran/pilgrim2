From the plot we can see that Bill pay correlates with Online variable. Interestingly the correlation between online and profitability is almost non existent. Correlation with age is only .14 while tenure and income are around the same number. 

Online and age have a negative .21 correlation which signifies that younger customers are more likely to be online and thus have a higher bill collection. 



Below we develop the model to predict profitability and try to include just age and
either the people are online or not.
Before we develop the model we explore the variance of profits using a box plot

```{r}
boxplot(train$X9Profit~X9Age,data=train, main="Profits 2009", 
  	xlab="Age Group", ylab="Profits")
```



```{r}

fit <- lm(X9Profit ~ X9Age + X9Online, data=train)
summary(fit) # show results
```
//TODO: EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE MODEL
Since the R squared metric indicates that the model does not really do a great job in explaining the data we try to include more variables to try to explain the data better:

```{r}
fit <- lm(X9Profit ~ X9Age + X9Online + X9Billpay + X9Tenure, data=train)
summary(fit)
```
We get slightly better measure of R squared but non the less still a very low number compared to what it should be. 
```{r}
summary(lm(X0Profit ~ X9Age + X9Inc + X9Billpay + X9Tenure, data=train))
train$predicted0 <- predict(lm(X0Profit ~ X9Age + X9Inc + X9Billpay + X9Tenure, data=train))
train$difference <- (train$X0Profit-train$predicted0)
summary(train$difference)
```
